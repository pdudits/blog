= Awestruct rake tests failing on windows

:awestruct-tags: [ruby, awestruct]

Ruby on Windows really seems to be a minefield of various dependency problems. Like `undefined method `debug?' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)`.

== Symptoms
For example, when trying to build Awestruct on windows platform, it looks like this:

[source,ruby]

== Cause
YUI compressor 0.9.6 (which is an old version, but that's what htmlcompressor, one of Awestruct's dependencies dictates) depends on gem popen4, which on Windows platform in turn depends on win32/popen3. which in turn doesn't exist on Windows Ruby 1.9.3.

== Solution
Add gem dependency

[source,ruby]
----
gem "win32-open3-19", :platforms => :mingw

== Java guy wonders
Why I had to find the cause by adding `puts` statements in standard libraries, instead seing stack trace of the actual cause in the error?
