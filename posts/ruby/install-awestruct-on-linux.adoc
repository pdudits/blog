Actually I thought since Ruby libraries are so strongly Windows-related, no
setup will be needed to launch this blog on Linux I had put on the thumbdrive
for Devoxx. I was wrong.

What I tried was `apt-get install rake && rake preview`. The command completed
and virtually nothing happened. Then I recalled that I need to do `rake setup` first.
Nothing happened as well. So I removed rake again and with trial and error I arrived
to this sequence have it running:

[source,language="bash"]
----
sudo gem install bundler rake
apt-get install build-essential ruby-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
rake setup
----

And after two superb conference days, I can finally start writing down my impressions
of Devoxx 2014!
